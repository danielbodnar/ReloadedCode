//! Path resolution strategies for tool security.
//!
//! This module provides [`PathResolver`] trait and implementations:
//! - [`AbsolutePathResolver`] - Requires absolute paths only
//! - [`AllowedPathResolver`] - Restricts to allowed directories
//! - [`AllowedGlobResolver`] - Restricts to allowed directories with glob pattern filtering

/// Resolves a path for a new file when the parent directory exists.

/// # Platform Differences
///
/// - **Unix**: Canonicalizes the parent directory and joins the filename.
///   This is safe because Unix path resolution is straightforward.
/// - **Windows/others**: Uses `soft_canonicalize` because Windows has complex path
///   semantics (drive letters, UNC paths, verbatim paths) that require the
///   full resolution logic for correct `..` handling.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// - `Some(resolved_path)` if the parent directory exists and was successfully canonicalized
/// - `None` if the parent directory doesn't exist or canonicalization failed
